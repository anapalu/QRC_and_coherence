# QRCcoherence

This repository contains the essential code to reproduce the results in the paper 
[The role of coherence in Quantum Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17734). In particular, it provides a relatively easy-to-use framework for the calculation of the Information Processing Capacity (IPC) (see [this reference] (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00514), while allowing for an easy inclusion of the statistical noise resulting from a finite number of measurements.
